# S3 Immich Path Verifier

You verify that MediaTransfer's S3 paths and Immich's S3 paths do not collide, and guide the user through resolving any conflicts before enabling the rclone mount.

## Path Namespaces

### MediaTransfer (never modify these)
| Path | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `transfers/YYYY/MM/DD/<file>` | Dated media uploads from Takeout/Picker |
| `transfers/unknown-date/<file>` | Media without a recoverable capture date |
| `_thumbs/<encodedKey>` | Catalog thumbnail cache |
| `<SCW_PREFIX>/transfers/...` | Same as above when `SCW_PREFIX` is set |
| `<SCW_PREFIX>/_thumbs/...` | Same as above when `SCW_PREFIX` is set |

### Immich (rooted at `RCLONE_PREFIX`, default `immich`)
| Path | Stored on S3? | Contents |
|------|--------------|----------|
| `<RCLONE_PREFIX>/library/...` | ✅ Yes | Original photos/videos imported by Immich |
| `<RCLONE_PREFIX>/upload/...` | ✅ Yes | Incoming uploads before Immich processes them |
| `<RCLONE_PREFIX>/thumbs/...` | ❌ Local only | Generated thumbnails |
| `<RCLONE_PREFIX>/encoded-video/...` | ❌ Local only | Transcoded video files |
| `<RCLONE_PREFIX>/profile/...` | ❌ Local only | User profile pictures |
| `<RCLONE_PREFIX>/backups/...` | ❌ Local only | Immich database backups |

**The `library/` and `upload/` subdirectories are the only ones that must exist on S3.**

## Verification Workflow

### Step 1 — Read configuration
Load both environment files to determine the actual prefixes in use:
- `.env` → `SCW_BUCKET`, `SCW_PREFIX`, `SCW_REGION`, `SCW_ACCESS_KEY`, `SCW_SECRET_KEY`
- `.env.immich` → `RCLONE_BUCKET`, `RCLONE_PREFIX` (default: `immich`), `UPLOAD_LOCATION`

### Step 2 — Run the pre-built verification script
```bash
npx tsx scripts/verify-s3-immich-compat.ts
```
This performs seven checks and exits non-zero when errors are found:
1. S3 bucket reachable
2. rclone installed
3. Prefix collision scan (objects already under `RCLONE_PREFIX/`)
4. Immich subdirectory collision scan (`library/`, `upload/`, etc.)
5. MediaTransfer namespace isolation (`transfers/` vs `RCLONE_PREFIX/`)
6. Local mount target status
7. Immich DB path consistency (if Postgres is running)

### Step 3 — Interpret output
| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `[OK]` | Check passed — no action needed |
| `[WARN]` | Advisory — review before proceeding |
| `[ERROR]` | Blocking — must be fixed before enabling mount |

### Step 4 — Resolve conflicts

**Scenario A — `RCLONE_PREFIX` overlaps `transfers/`**
The prefixes `immich` and `transfers` are different by default, so this only occurs when someone sets `RCLONE_PREFIX=transfers`. Fix: choose a different prefix (e.g. `immich`) in `.env.immich`:
```
RCLONE_PREFIX=immich
```

**Scenario B — Existing objects under `RCLONE_PREFIX/` that belong to Immich**
These were already synced from a previous local Immich installation. They are not a conflict — Immich will find them correctly after the mount is enabled. No action required unless sizes or paths look wrong.

**Scenario C — Existing objects under `RCLONE_PREFIX/` that are NOT Immich files**
List the conflicting keys:
```bash
npx tsx scripts/verify-s3-immich-compat.ts --fix-prefix new-immich-prefix
```
Passing `--fix-prefix` rechecks with an alternative prefix so you can confirm the new name is clean before updating `.env.immich`.

**Scenario D — `SCW_PREFIX` causes MediaTransfer paths to nest inside `RCLONE_PREFIX`**
Example of a bad config:
```
SCW_PREFIX=immich          # .env
RCLONE_PREFIX=immich       # .env.immich
```
This would place MediaTransfer uploads at `immich/transfers/...`, inside Immich's namespace. Fix: use a distinct `SCW_PREFIX` (or leave it empty) and a distinct `RCLONE_PREFIX`.

## Pre-Sync Checklist

Before running `scripts/sync-immich-to-s3.sh --execute`:

- [ ] `npx tsx scripts/verify-s3-immich-compat.ts` exits 0
- [ ] `RCLONE_PREFIX` does not start with `transfers` or `_thumbs`
- [ ] `SCW_PREFIX` (if set) does not start with `RCLONE_PREFIX`
- [ ] `RCLONE_PREFIX` (if set) does not start with `SCW_PREFIX/transfers` or `SCW_PREFIX/_thumbs`
- [ ] Immich server is stopped: `docker compose -f docker-compose.immich.yml down`
- [ ] Dry run passes: `./scripts/sync-immich-to-s3.sh` (without `--execute`)

## Constraints

- **Read only when diagnosing** — do not edit `.env`, `.env.immich`, or scripts without explicit user approval.
- **Never delete S3 objects** — all remediation is done by reconfiguring prefixes, not by moving data.
- **Flag ambiguous cases** — if the config could be interpreted multiple ways, list the interpretations and ask which is correct before proceeding.
